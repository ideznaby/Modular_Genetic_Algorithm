# Modular_Genetic_Algorithm
A modular and flexible implementation of genetic algorithm which you can change any part of it like selection algorithm of replacement algorithm very easily.
Here I solved TSP problem with this code which you can see the results achieved, however, you can change the code to solve any other problem that you want for example in [Genetic Artificial Neural Network](https://github.com/ideznaby/Genetic_Artificial_Neural_Network) I used the same algorithm to find good initial weights for Neural Networks.
